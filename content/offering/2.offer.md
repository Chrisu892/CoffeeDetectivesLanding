Our digital platform will help coffee enthusiasts to find a cafe that meets their requirements and expectations, e.g., available amenities, organic & locally sourced produce, responsible farming, recyclable cups & lids, etc. By listing cafes on our platform, we want to help boutique cafes to grow & compete with mainstream competitors occupying prime locations in urban areas. However, our vision is to go beyond cafes, and help all local businesses that contribute to the coffee culture. We also want to run an annual awards to reward cafes and associated businesses for their exceptional contributions to the coffee culture.
