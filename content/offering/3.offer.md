To create a go-to digital platform for all coffee enthusiasts where they can participate in discussions, write reviews, and vote for their favourite independent cafes. Part of our mission is to promote healthier choices of produce and more concious choice of packaging. We want to leave a positive footprint on the planet by reducing food and plastic waste, and create economic opportunities for local cafes, roasters, and farmers. We have many other ideas, don't forget to sign up to our mailing list to stay up-to-date.
