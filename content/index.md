longTitle: Uncover Hidden Coffee Gems in Your City
mtagline: Navigate the urban coffee scene like never before. Find, rate, and share your favourite local cafe discoveries with fellow aficionados.

tagline: We want to put local independent cafes on the map
content: There are many independent cafes serving great tasting coffee but only few people know about them because those cafes are away from expensive high streets with large footfall. Google and other search engines supposed to help but in digital economy, they prioritise mainstream cafes that pay for advertising. We want to change this. Our mission is to challenge the status quo of monopoly chains and with your help, uncover hidden gems around you for everyone to explore.

tagline2: For the love of good coffee
content2: Our guiding principles in the quest for great tasting coffee.

tagline3: Our value proposition is simple
content3: We want to create a go-to platform for coffee hobbyists and cafe owners.

tagline4: A go-to platform for all coffee aficionados
content4: We aim to create an online platform that we want to become a vibrant hub for coffee enthusiasts seeking unique, independent cafes that infuse artistry into every cup. By unveiling hidden gems beyond the usual haunts, our platform not only broadens your horizons but also empowers you to make informed and health-conscious choices. We recognise that boutique cafes struggle to vie with large chains that dominate prime locations and marketing channels. Despite the common use of Google Maps, social media, and review sites, these outlets often overlook the smaller establishments, favouring those who can afford prominence. Our mission is to level the playing field, providing discerning individuals with the insights needed to appreciate the distinct offerings of each cafe, all while fostering environmentally responsible decision-making.

tagline5: For cafe owners
content5: Our platform is designed to empower local independent cafe owners seeking to enhance their customer outreach and visibility. Our goal is to help these businesses get discovered and flourish by promoting their unique offerings, thereby driving customer traffic, retention, and ultimately, profitability. We understand the power of online presenceâ€”it translates into more visitors, sales, and sustainable growth through positive reviews, loyalty programs, and word-of-mouth recommendations. Committed to providing cost-effective solutions, our platform offers valuable exposure without the hefty price tag, ensuring that even the quaintest of cafes can secure a spot in the bustling digital marketplace.

tagline6: Who said that coffee break has to to be mainstream?
content6: Hi there! My name is Chris, and I love a great tasting coffee. Whenever I go to town or visit a new place, I'm always on the lookout to discover a good cafe to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee. However, I never know where to find an independent cafe, and instead, end up at one of the mainstream cafes.

tagline7: Value proposition
content7: We want our online platform to help everyone who want to find a local independent cafe expecting quality, organic, sustainable artisan coffee, with great customer service and unique decor, and gaining confidence that they can use our platform to find a cafe that meets their requirements, where baristas know their craft.
