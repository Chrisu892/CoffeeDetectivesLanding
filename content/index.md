Whenever I go to town or visit a new place, I'm always on the lookout to discover a good cafe to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee. However, I never know where to find an independent cafe, and instead, end up at one of the mainstream cafes.

content4: We want our online platform to help everyone who want to find a local independent cafe expecting quality, organic, sustainable artisan coffee, with great customer service and unique decor, and gaining confidence that they can use our platform to find a cafe that meets their requirements, where baristas know their craft.
